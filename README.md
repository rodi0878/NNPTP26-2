## Workspace backup and restore (FEATURE-005)

Use the following commands either interactively or as application arguments:

```text
workspace export "backup.zip"
workspace import "backup.zip"
workspace import "external-csv-directory"
```

Export writes a compressed ZIP snapshot of the current session, including unsaved
changes. The destination must not already exist; its parent directory must exist.
Import **replaces the entire current workspace**, rather than merging records.
Back up your current workspace first. Imported changes are saved to `.taskpulse`
when the application exits, like other commands.

A bundle must contain `projects.csv`, `tasks.csv`, and `worklogs.csv` at its root,
using the same UTF-8 headers and column order as TaskPulse's CSV storage. Include
header-only files for empty entity collections. Import accepts either a directory
containing those files or a ZIP containing exactly those three entries. ZIP paths,
duplicate entries, missing files, incorrect headers, invalid values and broken
project/task references are rejected before the current session is changed.
Each imported CSV file is limited to 64 MiB of uncompressed data. Other files in a
CSV directory are ignored. Paths containing spaces should be quoted interactively.
